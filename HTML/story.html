    <p class="story_text">
        Before moving to the Netherlands, our founder Yu Ma was a highly respected sushi chef in Nagasaki.
        He started his career helping his father and eventually owned his own stall in Nagasaki's business district.
        In 1984, Yu Ma emigrated to the Netherlands and founded Panko Yu, trying to recreate what he started in Japan.
        When he died in 2002, his son Yu Na took over.

        We are a specialty sushi restaurant and still hold firmly to our roots, because we believe that the best sushi is created when using the experience of masters.
        We hope to see you soon, Yu Na is waiting!
